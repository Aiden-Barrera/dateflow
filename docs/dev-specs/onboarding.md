# Dateflow — Dev Specs Onboarding Guide

Welcome to Dateflow. This document gives you the full picture of how the system works in about 5 minutes. For implementation details, each section links to the full dev spec.

---

## What Dateflow Does in One Sentence

Two people who want to go on a first date each enter their preferences, swipe on AI-curated nearby venues, and the first mutual like becomes the plan.

---

## The User Flow (End to End)

```
Person A opens Dateflow → enters location, budget, categories
    → gets a share link → sends it to Person B
Person B opens the link → enters their preferences
    → AI generates 12 nearby venues in 3 rounds of 4
Both swipe independently (private until match)
    → First mutual like = match → directions + calendar export
```

No account required. No app install. Works on any mobile browser.

## How the System Is Organized

There are **6 dev specs** that map to the flow above. They build on each other in a chain, with one independent branch:

```
DS-01 Session Management ← start here, everything depends on this
  │
  ├── DS-02 Preference Input
  │     └── DS-03 Venue Generation Engine
  │           └── DS-04 Swipe & Match System
  │                 └── DS-05 Post-Match Actions
  │
  └── DS-06 Session History (can be built in parallel with DS-02 through DS-05)
```

## Spec-by-Spec Summary

### [DS-01 — Session Management](./ds-01-session-management.md)

**What it does:** Creates and manages the planning session that two people share. Person A starts a session, gets a share link, Person B opens the link and joins.

**Why it matters:** This is the foundation. Every other spec reads from or writes to the `sessions` table. The zero-account, zero-install entry point is what makes the product accessible — if this feels heavy, the entire downstream flow breaks.

**Key decisions:**
- Sessions are identified by UUID v4 (not guessable, no auth needed)
- Sessions expire after 48 hours (pg_cron cleans up stale ones)
- No PII collected — no name, email, or phone number at this stage

**Classes:** `Session`, `SessionService`, `ShareLink`, `ShareLinkService`
**Endpoints:** `POST /api/sessions`, `GET /api/sessions/[id]`
**Tables:** `sessions`

---

### [DS-02 — Preference Input](./ds-02-preference-input.md)

**What it does:** Collects each person's location, budget, and activity category preferences. When both people have submitted, the session transitions to `both_ready` and triggers venue generation.

**Why it matters:** These inputs are what make the recommendation engine personal. Location drives the midpoint calculation (where to search), budget sets the price ceiling, and categories determine what types of venues to surface. Without both sets of preferences, the AI has nothing to work with.

**Key decisions:**
- Location can come from GPS (browser Geolocation API) or manual entry (zip/city, geocoded via Google)
- Budget uses three tiers: `BUDGET`, `MODERATE`, `UPSCALE` — maps to Google Places price levels
- "Surprise me" selects all four categories (restaurant, bar, activity, event)
- One preference per role per session, enforced by a DB unique constraint

**Classes:** `Preference`, `PreferenceService`, `Location`, `BudgetLevel`, `Category`
**Endpoints:** `POST /api/sessions/[id]/preferences`
**Tables:** `preferences`

### [DS-03 — Venue Generation Engine](./ds-03-venue-generation.md)

**What it does:** Takes both users' preferences, calculates the geographic midpoint, fetches nearby venue candidates from Google Places, filters them for first-date safety, and uses Claude (Sonnet 4.6) to score and rank 12 venues into 3 rounds of 4.

**Why it matters:** This is the intelligence layer — the thing that turns raw Google Places data into a curated shortlist that feels like a friend who knows the city recommended it. The safety filter (US-07) is a core differentiator: venues must be public, accessible, conversation-friendly, and easy to leave.

**Key decisions:**
- Generation is async (Upstash QStash job queue) — takes 2–5 seconds, users see a loading state
- Google Places results are cached in Redis (6h TTL, keyed by coordinate grid + categories) to reduce API cost
- 3 rounds: Round 1 = highest consensus, Round 2 = category diversity, Round 3 = wildcards
- If Claude is unavailable, falls back to pure Places API ranking (no AI, but the product still works)
- If the midpoint falls in an empty area, two separate searches run from each user's location

**Scoring algorithm (5 weighted dimensions):**

| Dimension | Weight | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| Category overlap | 0.30 | Does this venue match what both users selected? |
| Distance to midpoint | 0.25 | Is it equidistant and reachable for both? |
| First-date suitability | 0.25 | AI-scored: noise, safety, ease of exit, ambiance |
| Quality signal | 0.15 | Google rating adjusted by review count |
| Time-of-day fit | 0.05 | Is this venue appropriate for the planned time? |

**Classes:** `Venue`, `VenueScore`, `VenueGenerationService`, `PlacesAPIClient`, `AICurationService`, `SafetyFilter`, `MidpointCalculator`, `VenueCache`
**Endpoints:** `POST /api/sessions/[id]/generate` (internal), `GET /api/sessions/[id]/venues`
**Tables:** `venues`

### [DS-04 — Swipe & Match System](./ds-04-swipe-match.md)

**What it does:** Both users independently swipe like/pass on venue cards. Swipes are private — neither person sees the other's choices. The moment both people like the same venue, a match fires and both are redirected to the result page.

**Why it matters:** Private swiping is the core mechanic that removes the social awkwardness of suggesting a venue. Neither person has to commit first or risk rejection. The progressive round system (3 rounds of 4) prevents dead ends — if no match in round 1, round 2 loads automatically with different vibes.

**Key decisions:**
- Match detection is atomic: a Postgres RPC function (`record_swipe_and_check_match`) inserts the swipe and checks for a mutual like in a single transaction with row-level locking. This prevents race conditions when both users swipe simultaneously.
- Swipes are idempotent (unique constraint on `session_id, venue_id, role` + upsert)
- Both users see venues in the same order but swipe independently
- After round 3 with no mutual match, a force resolution picks the closest option and explains why
- Realtime notifications via Supabase WebSocket, with 5-second polling as a fallback if the connection drops

**Round progression:**
```
Round 1 (venues 1–4)  → highest-consensus picks
Round 2 (venues 5–8)  → different categories and vibes
Round 3 (venues 9–12) → wildcards, relaxed constraints
Still no match?       → force resolution with best available
```

**Classes:** `Swipe`, `SwipeService`, `MatchDetector`, `RoundManager`
**Endpoints:** `POST /api/sessions/[id]/swipes`, `GET /api/sessions/[id]/status`
**Tables:** `swipes`

---

### [DS-05 — Post-Match Actions](./ds-05-post-match-actions.md)

**What it does:** Displays the matched venue with its photo, rating, address, and tags. Offers two immediate actions: get directions (deep link to Google/Apple Maps) and add to calendar (ICS file download).

**Why it matters:** The match reveal is the emotional peak of the product — equivalent to Tinder's "It's a Match!" but for a concrete plan. The directions and calendar actions close the loop from "we agreed" to "it's on my calendar and I know how to get there." Without these, the match is just information; with them, it's an actionable commitment.

**Key decisions:**
- Platform detection (iOS vs Android vs desktop) determines whether to deep link to Apple Maps or Google Maps
- Calendar export generates a standard ICS file (works with Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook)
- No new database tables — DS-05 is read-only against existing `sessions` and `venues` tables
- The result page URL (`/plan/[id]/results`) is shareable — both users access the same page

**Classes:** `MatchResult`, `DirectionsService`, `CalendarExportService`
**Endpoints:** `GET /api/sessions/[id]/result`, `GET /api/sessions/[id]/calendar`
**Tables:** none (reads from `sessions` and `venues`)

---

### [DS-06 — Session History](./ds-06-session-history.md)

**What it does:** Adds optional lightweight accounts (email or Google OAuth) so returning users can see their past sessions. Sessions are linked to accounts retroactively — you can complete a full session without an account, then create one to save it.

**Why it matters:** This is the retention play. The MVP works entirely without accounts (DS-01 through DS-05), but repeat users who go on multiple first dates want to avoid suggesting the same venue twice. Session history gives them a reason to come back and a reason to create an account.

**Key decisions:**
- Accounts are Phase 2 — never required for the core flow
- Account creation is prompted after a successful match (moment of highest engagement), not before
- Sessions are linked via a `session_accounts` join table, not a direct FK — this preserves the accountless MVP flow
- Session ID is stored in localStorage during the session for retroactive linking on account creation
- Default history view only shows `matched` sessions (not expired or failed ones)

**Classes:** `Account`, `AccountService`, `SessionHistoryService`
**Endpoints:** `POST /api/auth/register`, `POST /api/auth/login`, `GET /api/sessions/history`
**Tables:** `accounts`, `session_accounts`

## Session Lifecycle (How Status Flows)

Every session moves through these statuses. Each transition is owned by a specific spec:

```
pending_b (DS-01) → both_ready (DS-02) → generating (DS-03) → ready_to_swipe (DS-03) → matched (DS-04)
                                           ↓
                                    generation_failed (DS-03) → retry → generating
```

Any pre-matched session can expire after 48 hours (DS-01).
